# Halloween 2023!

I found an [AdaBox20](https://learn.adafruit.com/adabox020) sitting unopened a few weeks before Halloween 2023.  Figured it would be fun to build something with it.  This is all [CircuitPyton](https://circuitpython.org/).

A lot of this code was taken from the wonderful learn.adafruit.com [page](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-eyelights-led-glasses-and-driver/blinky-eyes) that covers these glasses.

Do the normal CircuitPython thing and copy these onto the USB drive associated with the microcontroller you are using.
